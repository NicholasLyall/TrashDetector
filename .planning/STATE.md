## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Fine granularity with 10 phases -- vertical slice priority (live feed E2E first)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 7, 8, 9 can parallelize after Phase 6 completes
- [Roadmap]: Phase 5 (backend) can start early but must complete before Phase 6 (integration)
- [Phase 01]: Tailwind v4 CSS-first config: create-next-app@16 defaults to Tailwind v4 with @import syntax
- [Phase 01]: shadcn/ui base-nova style with oklch color space (latest default)
- [Phase 01]: Navigation config uses readonly NAV_ITEMS array with lucide-react icons for type-safe nav
- [Phase 01]: Mobile sidebar uses shadcn/ui Sheet component for responsive drawer overlay
- [Phase 02]: Scenic SVG illustration (hills, trees, clouds) for hero background instead of abstract shapes
- [Phase 02]: Mock data centralized in lib/mock-data.ts for clean swap to live data in Phase 6
- [Phase 02]: Dashboard feature components organized in components/dashboard/ directory

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pi hardware not ready -- build with mock/seed data, wire Pi integration later (v2)
- Supabase project exists but credentials need to be configured during Phase 5
